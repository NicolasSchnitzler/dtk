Global stuff:
- Handle layer. It's related to the naming convention. **
- Handle the license for plugins.
- Add Doxygen comments.

On the Generator:
- Being able to modify the templates relatively to the Abstract level needs. **

On the main:
- Anyoption should be replaced:
    + No way to have mandatory option for instance.
    + No way to have more than one Synopsis line.
    + Bugging many times.
