# Things remaining to do: #
# ####################### #

Global stuff:
- Handle layer. The regex from the interface still needs to be corrected. ** See BUG keyword in dtkGeneratorWizard.cpp file.
- Handle the license for plugins.
- Add Doxygen comments.

On the Generator:
- Being able to modify the templates relatively to the Abstract level needs. **

On the main:
- Anyoption should be replaced:
    + No way to have mandatory option for instance.
    + No way to have more than one Synopsis line.
    + Bugging many times.


** : higher priority
